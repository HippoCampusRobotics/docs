Event Camera Collaboration
##########################

.. note::
   The folloing instructions are targeting ROS2 because our whole framework is implemented in ROS2.
   The ``ros-event-camera`` packages are available for ROS1 **and** ROS2, though.
   All following instructions have ROS1 equivalents and should be fairly easy to adapt if required.

The Framework
=============

We use the packages from the ``ros-event-camera`` `GitHub project <https://github.com/ros-event-camera/>`__.
All packages should be available for both ROS1 and ROS2.
The ``libcaer_driver`` package is a generic ROS interface for sensors that communicate via ``libcaer``.
The ``event_camera_msgs`` and ``event_camera_codecs`` provide a very efficient way of encoding the sensor event data (see the `README <https://github.com/ros-event-camera/libcaer_driver/>`__ for details).

The Bag Files
=============

The vehicle name used in our set up is ``uuv02``, hence all vehicle related topic names are prefixed with ``uuv02``.

Converting ``mcap`` to ``sqlite3``
**********************************

Create a a ``yaml`` file

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: output.yaml
   :linenos:

   output_bags:
     - uri: <output_name>
       storage_id: sqlite3
       all: true

and run 

.. code-block:: console

   $ ros2 bag convert -i <BAGFILE_IN_MCAP_FORMAT> -o output.yaml


With Gantry
***********

.. code-block:: console

   $ ros2 bag info gantry_lemniscate_v_0.1

   Files:             gantry_lemniscate_v_0.1_0.mcap
   Bag size:          1.0 GiB
   Storage id:        mcap

The gantry position is published in the topics ``/gantry/motor_x/position`` and ``gantry/motor_y/position``.
Event camera data is published as ``/uuv02/event_camera/events`` and ``/uuv02/event_camera/imu``.

Without Gantry

As long as our Qualisys cameras are still(!) in service, we have to rely on the onboard visual localization.
The estimated pose and velocity is published as ``/uuv02/odometry``.
The event camera specific topics are the same as for the gantry setup.

Reading the Data
================

Concept
*******

We have prepared a basic example in ROS2 on how to to read the event_camera data.
Porting the code to ROS1 should be fairly easy and you can probably grasph the concept of it even though it is written for the ROS2 API.

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/HippoCampusRobotics/event_camera_example.git

This depends on the above mentioned `event_camera_codecs <https://github.com/ros-event-camera/event_camera_codecs>`__ and `event_camera_msgs <https://github.com/ros-event-camera/event_camera_msgs>`__.

Depending on your workflow, the dependency on ``dv-processing`` is not required.
In the example code, we show an example on how to store the ROS message data as ``dv::EventPacket``.
If you want to work with the raw events directly, you can omit this conversion and operate on the event data inside the ``eventCD()`` callback (``include/event_camera_example/event_updater.hpp``) without creating the ``dv::EventPacket``.

.. note::

   Inivation provides their software as prebuilt packages for 20.04 and 22.04 via their `PPA <https://launchpad.net/~inivation-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/inivation>`__.
   They store their non-system-default version of boost in a separate directory and `instruct CMAKE <https://launchpad.net/~inivation-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/inivation>`__ to use this boost version.
   This could be a more convenient way of avoiding boost version conflicts without the need to install anything manually besiders the inivation packages.


Run the Example
***************

Play the bag file

.. code-block:: console

   $ ros2 bag play <PATH_TO_THE_MCAP_FILE>

.. code-block:: console

   $ ros2 run event_camera_example example_node --ros-args -r __ns:=/uuv02
   .
   .
   .
   [INFO] [1707470874.889379640] [event_updater]: First event sensor time of current packet: 1707327667717551000 + 0
   [INFO] [1707470874.890289337] [event_updater]: EventPacket message contained 12894 events.
   [INFO] [1707470874.890313394] [uuv02.example_node]: I have a dv::EventPacket with 12894 events


Visualizing the Events
======================

The `event_camera_renderer <https://github.com/ros-event-camera/event_camera_renderer/>`__ creates images from events.
We can launch it via

.. code-block:: console

   $ ros2 launch event_camera_renderer renderer.launch.py camera:=uuv02/event_camera

and we can then view the rendered image via ``rqt_image_view``.
